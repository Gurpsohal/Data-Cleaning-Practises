# Data-Cleaning-Practise
This was a project to further deepen my understanding of the numpy and pandas libraries, evident in the grammatical error ridden notes. The project was diffcult as I found myself rummaging the respective libraries to truly grasp the libraries and their method syntax, but alas I conquered it. I am looking forward to applying the learnings of this project to future projects. 

The data was provided by Mo Chen.
